        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Here at SynthBrew™, we are the leading pioneers in interstellar coffee service. Out here, in the outer reaches of the Solar System,
        access to ingredients is scarce and so we have devised an industry leading process to create coffee from the inorganic material all around us.
        We recognise that the competition for coffee this far out is non-existent and so we admit our products aren't very good, however,
        we also recognise you have no choice if you want your caffeine fix. This is why we have chosen not to have competitive pricing
        and will absolutely drain you of your funds where possible. We are proud to offer an extremely limited variety of coffee and pastry products
        that are made with no love nor care as we just get the robot to do the job for us. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Why would you drink here? Honestly, we ask ourselves the same question everyday which, admittedly, isn't very often considering a day here is
        roughly 30 years on Earth. Did we mention we pay our workers a daily salary? As far as we know that's better than all the Earth coffee shops who
        pay monthly or weekly. But we just told you a day here is 30 years on Earth, should this worry you? Absolutely! Do we care? No.

                    <p>"I was blown away!" The coffee and pastries were so good I couldn't believe they were completely inorganic!
                        When I went to ask if I could purchase more they sounded the alarm and opened the airlock 
                        and so I was quite literally blown away. 
                        I have to give 5 stars for the unique experience offered.

                    <p class="stars">⭐⭐</p>
                    <p>After a long day of intergalactic conquest I was headed back to Earth when I saw the billboard for SynthBrew.
                        With my curiosity piqued, I set my navigation to Saturn's rings and made my way there.
                        Upon arrival there was a huge queue
                        but I placed my order before hand and so skipped it.
                        When I got my coffee they said they were all out of cups and asked me to cup
                        my hands where they proceeded to pour boiling hot coffee on them.
                        I have to give 2 stars though because the speed at which they got
                        me medical service was the quickest I've ever seen in this part of the solar system. It took them 3 days!
                    </p>

                    <p>When I asked for a pain au chocolat they threw rock hard pieces of chocolate at me. When I pointed to the item on the menu they
                        questioned me as to why I didn't ask for that in the first place and demanded I apologise for the misunderstanding and pay for
                        the wasted chocolate. Then when I received my actual pain au chocolat they said they couldn't provide the chocolate as
                        they already gave it to me.
