                <div class="drink"><h3>Cold Brew - 10,000credits</h3><img class="drinkimage" src="Images/cold_brew.jpeg" alt="Cold Brew"><p>What makes our cold brew special you may ask? Not much. 
                    In fact, it is actually just one of our other drinks that was left on the side for too long.</p></div>
                <div class="drink"><h3>Espresso - 20,000credits</h3><img class="drinkimage" src="Images/espresso.jpeg" alt="Espresso"><p>In a rush? Then the espresso is just for you! 
                    Order now and our employees will recognise that you're in a hurry and serve everyone else who comes in after you.</p></div>
                <div class="drink"><h3>Iced Coffee - 100,000credits</h3><img class="drinkimage" src="Images/iced_coffee.jpeg" alt="Iced Coffee"><p>We have decided to keep the Earth tradition of charging a premium for the inclusion of ice.
                    This way we don't have to make as much coffee as a regular cup but get to charge you a significant amount more.</p></div>

                <div class="drink"><h3>Latte - 30,000credits</h3><img class="drinkimage" src="Images/latte.jpeg" alt="Latte"><p>We have considered renaming this to Late as it will never be done on time. 
                    However, we can guarentee you'll receive it quicker if you order after someone has ordered an espresso.</p></div>
                <div class="drink"><h3>Matcha Beetroot - 500,000credits</h3><img class="drinkimage" src="Images/matcha_beetroot.jpeg" alt="Matcha Beetroot"><p>Our most premium drink as reflected by the price. Unfortunately,
                    the price is the only premium thing about it as the ingredients used are questionable at best. We also hope you don't expect it to be coloured as that is a waste of our time.</p></div>
