                     Instead we carefully hand pick a variety of rocks from the rings and grind them down to a fine powder to sprinkle on. It's probably not safe for consumption but no one has come back to complain so far. </p></div>

                     This is why we opted not to and instead collect rocks from Saturn's rings and paint them to look like croissants. At least they look nice when placed next to our cups of coffee.</p></div>
